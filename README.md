Notes the project:
* Firstly, I interpreted the brief's instructions not to use search engine APIs to mean "Do Web Scraping"
* Next, I decided to use an ASP.Net Core MVC template as this would allow me to create a basic UI quicker than the blank template
* After some research I opted to use the HTML agility pack library to perform the scraping
